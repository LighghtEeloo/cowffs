# CowFFs

Copy-on-write File FileSystem.

The project has 2 components at the time writing: CowFFs and RefFFs. Our current focus is on specifying invariants regarding our on-file file system, using RefFFs as a sample.

## Build & Run

Most Rust projects have the same interface for building and running. For example,

```zsh
cargo run --bin refffs
```
